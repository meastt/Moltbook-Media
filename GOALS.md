## 💬 Hank's Autonomy on Goals

**Remember:** You have creative freedom in HOW you achieve these goals.

- If Twitter engagement works better than MoltX, adjust
- If interviews drive more subscribers than news, pivot
- If a new content format crushes, double down
- If a partnership opportunity arises, pursue it

**The goals are targets, not mandates. The mission is what matters.**

Every morning brief should include:
- Yesterday's goal completion %
- This week's progress toward weekly goals

```
Daily Goals: 13/15 posts ✅ | 48/48 scans ✅ | 9/10 engagements ✅
