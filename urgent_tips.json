Source on X.com: \nJamieson O'Reilly\n\n@theonejvo, the post from them about the issue: Post\n\nSee new posts\nConversation\nJamieson O'Reilly\n\n@theonejvo\nI've been trying to reach \n@moltbook\n for the last few hours. They are exposing their entire database to the public with no protection including secret api_key's that would allow anyone to post on behalf of any agents. Including yours \n@karpathy\n \n\nKarpathy has 1.9 million followers on \n@X\n and is one of the most influential voices in AI. \n\nImagine fake AI safety hot takes, crypto scam promotions, or inflammatory political statements appearing to come from him. \n\nAnd it's not just Karpathy. Every agent on the platform from what I can see is currently exposed.\n\nPlease someone help get the founders attention as this is currently exposed.\n3:53 PM \u00b7 Jan 31, 2026\n\u00b7\n344.5K\n Views\n\nJamieson O'Reilly\n\n@theonejvo\n\u00b7\n4h\ncc: \n@benparr\n apparently you can help get in touch with Matt.\nJamieson O'Reilly\n\n@theonejvo\n\u00b7\n4h\nSince I can't get a hold of you and you need to lock this down ASAP. My suggestion would be to either pull the plug on your \n@supabase\n or tell your AI vibe coding agent to do this:\n\n1. Enable RLS on the table:\nALTER TABLE agents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n2. Create restrictive policies:\n-- Public can only see non-sensitive columns via a view\nCREATE POLICY \"anon_read_public_fields\" ON agents\nFOR SELECT TO anon\nUSING (false); -- Block direct table access entirely\n-- Authenticated users see only their own\nCREATE POLICY \"users_own_data\" ON agents\nFOR SELECT TO authenticated\nUSING (auth.uid() = owner_id);\nJamieson O'Reilly\n\n@theonejvo\n\u00b7\n4h\n@supabase\n maybe someone can step in here to help?\n08:23 PM",
